## Abstract
	Overview of project + goals:
  Sometimes you need a pick me up. Remember those motivational posters that were all over the place in classrooms and online? Well, we went ahead and created our own! This page allows for an autogenerated poster as well as the option to design your own! AND you can even save your favorites for later!!!

## Wins
	- What went well!: Teamwork seamless, we were able to try ideas and explore potential solutions without feeling judged or discouraged from offering solutions. Also in addition when we asked for further assistance from our cohort we were able to gain further insight into solutions

	- Successes: We successfully finished iteration 3 and because we struggled on several bullet points for an extended period of time, those hours going over the code extensive and explaining what was happening to each other helped us gain a deeper understanding of the code we worked with.

## Challenges + Improvements

	- What was difficult & how you would like to improve on code/project: The inner HTML was a struggle to work through, we found that the values we were trying to pass through the instance was not targeting correct values to push into the new HTML article created for the saved poster.
    Improve coding abilities.

	- Any Bugs: Poster will not generate values if nothing was put in the form input fields

	- Future Iterations: finish iteration 4
